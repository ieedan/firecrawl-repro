    "Welcome to Firecrawl",
    "Firecrawl is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean markdown for each. No sitemap required.",
    "How to use it?",
    "We provide an easy to use API with our hosted version. You can find the playground and documentation here. You can also self host the backend if you’d like.Check out the following resources to get started:",
    "API: Documentation",
    "SDKs: Python, Node",
    "LLM Frameworks: Langchain (python), Langchain (js), Llama Index, Crew.ai, Composio, PraisonAI, Superinterface, Vectorize",
    "Low-code Frameworks: Dify, Langflow, Flowise AI, Cargo, Pipedream",
    "Community SDKs: Go, Rust (v1)",
    "Others: Zapier, Pabbly Connect",
    "Want an SDK or Integration? Let us know by opening an issue.",

    "Powerful Capabilities",
    "LLM-ready formats: markdown, summary, structured data, screenshot, HTML, links, metadata",
    "The hard stuff: proxies, anti-bot mechanisms, dynamic content (js-rendered), output parsing, orchestration",
    "Lightning fast: Get results in seconds—built for speed and high-throughput use cases.",
    "Customizability: exclude tags, crawl behind auth walls with custom headers, max crawl depth, etc…",
    "Media parsing: pdfs, docx, images.",
    "Reliability first: designed to get the data you need - no matter how hard it is.",
